When burnt, Steel allows the user to push against nearby metal objects. Steelpushing is affected by the laws of physics. If a coinshot were to push on something that weighs more than them, they'd be pushed away. "

Many coinshots generally carry around a pouch of coins, for ease of access. A Coinshot can access their abilities by pressing $(k:key.cosmere.allomancy.push)$() Steel is the external pushing metal and one of four physical metals (alongside Iron, Pewter, and Tin)"
