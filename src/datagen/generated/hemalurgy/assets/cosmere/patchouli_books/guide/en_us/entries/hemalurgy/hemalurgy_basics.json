The power taken is always one from the relevant quadrant of the respective table, steel spikes taking physical allomantic powers, gold spikes taking hybrid feruchemical powers, and so on. The inconsistency lies in that the specific power stolen seems to be random, although there may be pattern to the apparent randomness - further research is necessary.$(br)",
